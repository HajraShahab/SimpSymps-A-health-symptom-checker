# SimpSymps-A-health-symptom-checker
A health symptom checker that allows users to self-diagnose health problems, learn about possible treatments, and find nearby hospitals and pharmacies. Our team created SimpSymps by using Python libraries including BeautifulSoup, Regex, Pandas, and JSON. We used several techniques such as API calls, and web scraping to design this symptom checker. SimpSymps could help authorities regulate the inflow of people in hospitals especially in times of crisis such as COVID-19 and provide guidance to those undergoing preliminary symptoms.
